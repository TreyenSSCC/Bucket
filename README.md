# Bucket - Version 0.0.8
Bucket is a programming language which I am coding. I plan on it being open source.

I am creating Bucket as the final project for my Computer Information Tech Capstone course at Southern State Community College.

Bucket may or may not be continued after the completion of the final project.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.6: Added a loop that detects if the user entered syntax and then prints out the syntax.
