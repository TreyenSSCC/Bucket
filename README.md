# Bucket - # Version 0.1.8a
This is a programming language that I am creating.

I am creating Bucket as the final project for my Computer Information Tech Capstone course at Southern State Community College.

Bucket may or may not be continued after the completion of the final project.


Update Log

**bucket.py** - # Version 0.1.8a - Made some syntax into functions for future use.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.7a - Added some functionality to the 'loop' syntax. It can now run 'pour' a set amount of times decided by the user. Started turning some of the syntax into functions for the 'loop' syntax. Added 'equal' syntax which can compare two strings or two vars. Strings cannot be compared to vars. Planning on having the 'loop' syntax run every other type of syntax. Cannot increment a var inside of the loop yet.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.6a - Worked on 'var' working with 'add'. Worked on adding the ability to save code. The 'pour' syntax can now print the 'var'.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.5a - Fixed a 'var' bug that appeared. Users are now able to store multiple words in a single var instance.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.4a - Added basic functionality to the var syntax. Users are able to store and see what they store. It cannot be changed what is store currently. Also, make sure to start at [000] and increment up from there. Starting higher will cause the wrong var to be grabbed when asked for. Note: Only one word can be sent to the string currently.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.3a - The 'pour' syntax is now able to print a string to the screen. Started work on the function of the 'var' syntax.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.2a - Changed 'input' syntax to 'fill'. Added 'loop' syntax.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.1a - Changed how the version number system works. Versions with 'a' at the end will be the main version. Versions with any other letters will be be modified versions, for when I want to experiment. Also, changed the 'print' syntax to 'pour' and added an error for when no input is given by the user.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.0: Added basic artimatic functions: add, sub, div, and div. Cleaned up the code. Rewrote how syntax was detected by the program.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.9: Started to add the function of ADD syntax. Made the syntax list expandable.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.7: Added func syntax to syntax list.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.6: Added a loop that detects if the user entered syntax and then prints out the syntax.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.5: Made syntax all lowercase. Added an exit and quit function that allows users to exit the program. User input is turned lowercase when grabbed now.
