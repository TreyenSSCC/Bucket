# Bucket - Version 0.2.8b
This is a programming language that I am creating.

I am creating Bucket as the final project for my Computer Information Tech Capstone course at Southern State Community College.

Bucket may or may not be continued after the completion of the final project.


Update Log

**bucket.py** - Version 0.2.8b - Made this the b version of Bucket. Started on adding the 'drop' syntax. This will allow users to add 'drops' top Bucket, like libraries in Python.
