# Bucket - Version 1.0.4
This is a programming language that I am creating.

I am creating Bucket as the final project for my Computer Information Tech Capstone course at Southern State Community College.

Bucket may or may not be continued after the completion of the final project.


Update Log

**bucket.py** Version 0.0.5: Made syntax all lowercase. Added an exit and quit function that allows users to exit the program. User input is turned lowercase when grabbed now.
