# Bucket - Version 0.2.9b
This is a programming language that I am creating.

Bucket was originally created for my final project for my Capstone class. The 'b' version will now be the main version, as I am keeping the 'a' version around for archival reasons. All future updates will be made to this Bucket version.

Update Log

**bucket.py** - Version 0.2.9b - Added 'func' syntax. This will allow users to create functions. Functions work inside the loops and ifs, and loops and ifs work inside of functions. Currently there is no way to view the contents of all of your functions, but that is a planned feature. I have decided to make this Bucket version the main version. I'll make the 'a' version just a static version for my college class.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.2.8b - Made this the b version of Bucket. Started on adding the 'drop' syntax. This will allow users to add 'drops' top Bucket, like libraries in Python.
