# Bucket - Version 0.1.3a
This is a programming language that I am creating.

I am creating Bucket as the final project for my Computer Information Tech Capstone course at Southern State Community College.

Bucket may or may not be continued after the completion of the final project.


Update Log

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.3a - The 'pour' syntax is now able to print a string to the screen. Started work on the function of the 'var' syntax.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.2a - Changed 'input' syntax to 'fill'. Added 'loop' syntax.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.1a - Changed how the version number system works. Versions with 'a' at the end will be the main version. Versions with any other letters will be be modified versions, for when I want to experiment. Also, changed the 'print' syntax to 'pour' and added an error for when no input is given by the user.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.1.0: Added basic artimatic functions: add, sub, div, and div. Cleaned up the code. Rewrote how syntax was detected by the program.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.9: Started to add the function of ADD syntax. Made the syntax list expandable.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.7: Added func syntax to syntax list.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.6: Added a loop that detects if the user entered syntax and then prints out the syntax.

**bucket.py** - Version 0.0.5: Made syntax all lowercase. Added an exit and quit function that allows users to exit the program. User input is turned lowercase when grabbed now.
